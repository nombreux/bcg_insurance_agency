* The backend is written in python. So you need to have 'fast api', 'uvicorn' , 'pandas' installed on your python environment/machine to run this. 
* The web app is in react and is in Typescript. And it uses yarn as package manager. You need to have 'yarn' installed on your machine to run this.
* Click on the 'start_backend_server.cmd' and 'start_webapp.cmd' to start the application.
* It uses the csv file in the server folder as a database. So dont remove it from there or do anything with it. Application will malfunction.
